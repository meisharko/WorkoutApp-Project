## Usage

To use this project, 
1.Sign up and create your profile: Upon launching the app, you will be prompted to sign up and create a profile. This involves providing basic personal information, such as your age, 
gender, height, and weight. This information is used to calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is used to determine how many calories you burn at rest.

2.Set your daily calorie limit: Once your profile is set up, you can set your daily calorie limit based on your goals. The app will provide recommendations based on your BMR and activity level, 
but you can adjust the limit as needed.

3.Track your exercise: The app provides a list of common exercises and their corresponding calorie burn rates. You can select the exercise you performed and enter the duration of your workout. 
The app will then calculate how many calories you burned during your workout and add it to your daily calorie count.

4.Track your calorie intake: The app allows you to log your food intake and the number of calories consumed. You can search for foods in the app's database or add custom entries.

5.Monitor your progress: The app provides feedback on your progress towards your daily calorie limit and your overall fitness goals. You can view graphs of your calorie intake and exercise history 
to help you stay on track.

6.Get motivation and reminders: The app provides motivational messages and reminders to help you stay on track with your fitness goals. You can customize the frequency of these messages in the app settings.
